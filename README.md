# Bookmarks2Emails
I had way too many bookmarks in my Chrome browser and I wanted to find a better way of actioning and viewing them. I was using the new Inbox from Gmail and I liked the idea of pinning emails and I decided there has to be a way to convert these bookmarks to emails so I could managed my tasks better. So I used the Python skills I had developed over the past few months and used the Beautiful Soup package to solve this problem. Now I have a much more organized set of bookmarks.
